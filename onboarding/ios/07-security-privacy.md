# üîê Security & Privacy

## Secure Storage
- Use **Keychain** for storing sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, and certificates.
- Avoid storing sensitive data in UserDefaults or plist files.
- Remove sensitive data from storage as soon as it is no longer needed.
- Regularly audit storage locations for sensitive data leaks.

## Permissions
- Request only essential permissions (e.g., location, camera, microphone, photos).
- Explain the reason for each permission in the `Info.plist` using the appropriate usage description key (e.g., `NSCameraUsageDescription`).
- Show a just-in-time rationale to users before the system prompt, especially for sensitive permissions.
- Handle permission denial gracefully and provide alternative flows if possible.
- Regularly review and minimize the list of requested permissions.
- Document all permissions in your privacy policy.
