## 1. Basics of Jetpack Compose

- **Understand Declarative UI**  
  Learn how Compose differs from the traditional View-based system by focusing on building UI with declarative programming.
- **Setup Environment**  
  Install Android Studio (latest version) and configure the project for Jetpack Compose.
- **Composables**  
  Explore `@Composable` functions to create UI elements and understand UI hierarchy.
- **Previewing UIs**  
  Use the `@Preview` annotation to visualize your UI within Android Studio.
